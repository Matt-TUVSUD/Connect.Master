                        Finding/Recommendation: Within this dashboard, these terms are synonymous.  Completing a finding/recommendation is a way for you to reduce risk within your organization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Active: A recommendation with a status of Outstanding, In Progress, or Advisory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Closed: A recommendations with a status of Conf. Completed, Rptd. Completed, or Removed.  The year that a recommedation was closed is the year of the 
                        Status Date for Conf. Completed and Removed recommendations.  For Rptd. Completed recommendations, the year that a recommedation was closed is 
                        the year of the Response Date.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Risk Improvement: For Infrared, the risk improvement is a function of the recommendation's severity, where the more severe 
                        recommendations have a larger value for risk improvement once the recommendation has been closed.
