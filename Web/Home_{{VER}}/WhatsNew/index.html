                    The "Build-Your-Own dashboard" gives you the ability to produce your own dashboards using the data that you provide and TÜV SÜD GRC collects on your behalf.  While we strive
                    to deliver the canned dashboards to provide for your risk management needs, TÜV SÜD GRC recognizes that every business is unique and you may have some data needs that are not
                    covered in the dashboards that are provided in Connect.  This new functionality delivers a blank slate for you to build your own visuals and data tables to answer the questions
                    that we have not already answered for you.  At this time we are providing access to data regarding your locations and their ratings, recommendations, and other values such as
                    TIV and APL.  More data will be made available for you to enhance your own dashboards.  Please contact us and request specific information that you would like included that you
                    do not see in this new platform.

                    Organizations require sufficient risk management measures to minimize their exposures and potential for losses. With increasing regulatory and insurance requirements,
                    it is more important than ever to have proper controls and measures in place. To do this, the proper identification, evaluation and development of mitigation options is a must for
                    companies looking to minimize their risk. We support you with high quality risk analysis and in-depth risk management programs to help you to reduce your property loss history and expectancy,
                    and ensure safety and reliability for the future.
                    <br /><br />
                    The TÜV SÜD GRC Connect Dashboards provide clients with the business intelligence necessary to help meet these goals.
