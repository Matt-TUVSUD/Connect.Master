                    The Ratings Dashboard contains information about the ratings that TÜV SÜD GRC has produced as a result of our inspections of your locations.  
                    The dashboard includes overall ratings, individual scores and trends across the services that we provide to your organization.

                        counted as the "current" visit.

                <p class="contentP">
                    The Ratings Risk Profile shows risk at your locations by plotting the TIV against the score.  The size of the dot indicates the range of the APL, a larger dot
                    indicating a larger APL.

                <p class="contentP">
                    The Ratings Overview can be displayed for either Fire or B&amp;M.  Two pie charts are displayed along with a table detailing the data in the charts.<br />
                    The pie chart on the left displays the TIV of the locations summed by the risk rating.  The associated table includes the number of sites contributing to the pie segments.<br />
                    The pie chart on the right displays the TIV of the locations summed by the individual rating type selected in the Rating Type selection.  The associated table includes the number 
                    of sites contributing to the pie segments and more information about the rating.<br />

                <h3>Ratings Trends</h3>
                <p class="contentP">
                    The Ratings Trend chart can be displayed for either Fire or B&amp;M.  This chart shows the changes in ratings by year.  A year-over-year increase
                    would indicate that the ratings of your locations are increasing over time.  The ratings are segemented into Active and Passive (for Fire) or Management Programs
                    and Physical Assets (for B&amp;M) depending upon the selected service.  Also included is the Total Facility Score which may not be a sum of the other
                    two bars due to weighing factors that affect the way that GRC rates client locations.
